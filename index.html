			<h3>Early Days: Photogenic Drawing and the&#160;Daguerreotype</h3>
			<p>On May 9, 1839, the scientist and astronomer Sir John Frederick William Herschel wrote from Paris to William Henry Fox Talbot, a close friend and longtime scientific correspondent:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Though much pressed for time I cannot resist writing to you first to say that I have this moment left Daguerre&#8217;s who was so obliging as to shew us all his Pictures on Silver saved from the fire which burned his house and also one on glass. &#8212; It is hardly saying too much to call them miraculous. Certainly they surpass anything I could have conceived as within the bounds of reasonable expectation. The most elaborate engraving falls far short of the richness &#38; delicacy of execution[;] every gradation of light &#38; shade is given with a softness &#38; fidelity which sets all painting at an immeasurable distance.</p>
				<p>His <em>times</em> also are very short. &#8212; In a bright day 3 m suffices for the full effect up to the point where the lights become excessive. In dull or rainy days &#38; in the interior of an apartment <span>(</span>for copying sculptures and pictures) from 5 to 10 m are requisite.<a href="#note01" id="marker01"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>It is understandable that Herschel (1792&#8211;1871) was thrilled by his springtime visit to Paris. Louis-Jacques-Mand&#233; Daguerre&#8217;s discovery had been announced to the public on January 6, 1839, in the newspaper </span><em>Gazette de France,</em> and the story, with its description of his &#8220;beautiful designs,&#8221; received attention from both the British and the American press.</span><a href="#note2" id="marker2"><a href="#note02" id="marker02"><sup>2</sup></a></a> However, following the announcement, Daguerre (1787&#8211;1851) was involved in protracted negotiations with the French government regarding purchase rights to his process, and for almost eight months, between January and August, there was no explanation forthcoming as to exactly how he had accomplished this feat, or what chemical processes or materials might be involved. Outside France, few people had actually seen a daguerreotype.</span></p>
			<p>After reading about Daguerre&#8217;s accomplishment in the paper, but as yet having no idea how he had done it or what kind of images had been produced, Herschel spent much of January trying to figure it out for himself. The big question was how one might fix an image on a light-sensitive surface and render it permanent. Within just a few days, the industrious Herschel had come up with an answer: &#8220;Tried hyposulphite of soda to arrest action of light by washing away all the chloride of silver or other silvering salt,&#8221; he wrote in his notebook on January 29, 1839. &#8220;Succeeds perfectly.&#8221;</span><a href="#note03" id="marker03"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
			<p>As he would later learn on his trip to Paris, this process had little in common with Daguerre&#8217;s. Whereas the Frenchman produced his one-of-a-kind images on sheets of silver-plated copper, Herschel had been experimenting on paper made sensitive to light with silver salts. The paper-based process produced images that were pleasing in part because of their rather misty, impressionistic effects; they lacked the extraordinary clarity and detail of the daguerreotype. Indeed, as Herschel reportedly remarked to Fran&#231;ois Arago, director of the Paris Observatory and the issuer of his invitation to view Daguerre&#8217;s work, the paper process &#8220;produces nothing but vague, foggy things. There is as much difference between these two products as there is between the moon and the sun.&#8221;</span><a href="#note04" id="marker04"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
			<p>Herschel&#8217;s reaction to the markedly different look of the daguerreotype and, in his view, its superior achievement was thus generous as well as ecstatic. His letter to Talbot from Paris continues:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The beautiful effect of River Scenes <em>in rain</em> must be seen to be appreciated. Sculptures are rendered in their most minute details with a beauty quite inconceivable.</p>
				<p>In scenes of great detail, every letter in distant inscriptions &#8212; every chip in the corner of every stone in every building is reproduced &#38; distinctly recognizable with a strong lens[. A]ll the paving stones in <em>distant</em> chauss&#233;es are faithfully rendered.</p>
				<p>In short if you have a few days at your disposition I cannot command you better than to <em>Come &#38; See</em>. Excuse this ebullition.<a href="#note05" id="marker05"><sup>5</sup></a><span></span></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>It&#8217;s highly likely, however, that Herschel&#8217;s &#8220;ebullition&#8221; was <em>not</em> excused; in fact, every sentence of this letter must have set its recipient&#8217;s teeth on edge.</p>
			<p>Talbot (1800&#8211;1877), too, had been preoccupied with fixing camera images, but for much longer &#8212; ever since the summer of 1833, while honeymooning in Italy. In his attempts to sketch the scenery there, Talbot turned to the popular drawing device called the camera lucida. Through the use of lenses, it permitted the optical illusion that the scene surveyed or the object studied was superimposed on the paper before the draftsman. Talbot found it of little help in sketching the landscape, but it reminded him of something he had tried in Italy with a camera obscura some ten years prior, using &#8220;transparent tracing paper laid on a pane of glass in the focus of the instrument.&#8221; The objects on which the apparatus was trained could be seen on the paper and traced with a pencil. It now occurred to Talbot that it might be possible &#8220;to cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed upon the paper!&#8221;</span><a href="#note06" id="marker06"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
			<p>Early the following year, at home in England, Talbot set himself to work to find a means of sensitizing paper. This he had accomplished by the end of February 1834, with the use of silver chloride. He washed the paper in a salt solution and then brushed it with silver nitrate (which combined with the salt to form silver chloride). By placing small objects such as leaves or a piece of lace on the now light-sensitized paper outdoors in sunlight, he was able to temporarily produce an image, in negative &#8212; what we might now call a photogram and Talbot then called a &#8220;copy.&#8221;</p>
			<p>Talbot knew that if after the image was made the paper might be rendered no longer sensitive to light, the image could be permanently fixed and, just as significant, he might be able to reproduce multiple, positive instances of it. His initial attempts at fixing by use of a strong salt solution were not fully successful, however, and these first images, though lasting long enough to be viewed and admired, ultimately tended to fade away. Talbot called them &#8220;reversals.&#8221;</p>
			<p>Possibly the earliest mention of Talbot&#8217;s temporary successes comes in a thank-you note from his sister-in-law Laura Mundy on December 12, 1834:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Thank you very much for sending me such beautiful shadows, the little drawing I think quite lovely, that &#38; the verses particularly excite my admiration, I had no idea the art could be carried to such perfection &#8212; I had grieved over the gradual disappearance of those you gave me in the summer &#38; am delighted to have these to supply their place in my book.<a href="#note07" id="marker07"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>It seems likely that those &#8220;beautiful shadows&#8221; were photograms, but the &#8220;little drawing&#8221; was probably the result of Talbot&#8217;s further experimentation, now with wood boxes, in an effort to capture the image that might be thrown by light through a glass lens onto sensitized paper.</p>
			<p>Throughout the spring, and the unusually sunny summer, of 1835, Talbot continued to set up box cameras on the grounds of his country house, Lacock Abbey. One negative from those months &#8212; the image size is less than an inch square &#8212; is preserved today in Bradford, at the National Media Museum, with a note written by Talbot: &#8220;Latticed Window (with the Camera Obscura) August 1835. &#8212; When first made, the squares of glass about 200 in number could be counted, with the [</span><em>sic</em>] help of a lens&#8221; </span>(</span>fig. 1</span>).</span><a href="#note08" id="marker08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

			</div>
			<p>More than two years passed, during which time Talbot did not hurry to make public his process &#8212; presumably because he was still unable to satisfactorily resolve the problem of fixing the image. The images from the summer of 1835 ultimately began to fade away; Lacock Abbey&#8217;s two hundred panes of glass, initially so miraculous in their detail, could not be retained. Finally, however, in November 1838, Talbot returned to the topic and began to draft a paper on his findings to present to the Royal Society. And then, just after the New Year in 1839, came the announcement of Daguerre&#8217;s accomplishment. Lacking details about what, exactly, Daguerre had been able to produce, able to learn only that in some way Daguerre, too, had managed to fix camera images made by light, Talbot felt surprised, affronted, and even cheated out of his role as photographic pioneer.</p>
			<p>Talbot didn&#8217;t want to wait to find out how Daguerre was making </span><em>his</em> images permanent; it was in Talbot&#8217;s interest to prove that he knew nothing about Daguerre&#8217;s results and that his discoveries took precedence over them. Talbot, as we know, had not solved the problem of the gradual disappearance of the images that had been so beautifully captured on paper. Nonetheless, galvanized by Daguerre&#8217;s announcement, he rushed to present some examples of his own process to the Royal Society on January 25, and on January 31 he read a hastily drafted paper to the society explaining exactly how and when he had made his images of &#8220;flowers and leaves; a pattern of lace; figures taken from painted glass; a view of Venice copied from an engraving; some images formed by the Solar Microscope &#8230; various pictures, representing the architecture of my house in the country; all these made in the summer of 1835.&#8221;</span><a href="#note09" id="marker09"><sup>9</sup></a> On January 25 he also wrote to Sir John Herschel, who had been following the story with interest, to tell his old friend that he himself had in fact &#8220;discovered about five years ago &#8230; the possibility of fixing upon paper the image formed by a Camera Obscura; or rather, I should say, causing it to </span><em>fix itself</em>.&#8221;</span><a href="#note10" id="marker10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
			<p>It&#8217;s a little surprising that Talbot, despite a correspondence of many years with Herschel on matters scientific and horticultural, appears not to have previously mentioned to him any of the experiments at Lacock Abbey with cameras. Was his motive competitiveness? Was it a desire to bring his &#8220;photogenic drawing&#8221; (as he called his process) to more sophisticated and permanent ends before sharing it with the rest of the world? Whatever the reasons for his earlier silence, now that news of Daguerre&#8217;s invention was being covered by the leading scientific publications of the day, Talbot decided it was time that Herschel should call on him in London to view &#8220;specimens of this curious process.&#8221;</span><a href="#note11" id="marker11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
			<p>On January 27, however, Herschel wrote back from his country house in Slough to say that he was unable to get to town, owing to &#8220;many engagements to say nothing of a rheumatic affliction which confines me a large portion of each day to my bed.&#8221;</span><a href="#note12" id="marker12"><sup>12</sup></a> Talbot would have to pay a visit to Herschel instead.</span></p>
			<p>Since Herschel&#8217;s entry in his personal notebook regarding his success with sodium hyposul-phite as a fixing agent is dated only two days after that, on January 29, it&#8217;s hard not to imagine the astronomer </span>(</span>fig. 2</span>) in his dressing gown, feeling under the weather (or possibly not), but nonetheless trying to come up with his own fixer before Talbot </span>(</span>fig. 3</span>) could show up in Slough with his &#8220;specimens.&#8221; In any event, the day after his discovery, on January 30, Herschel wrote again to Talbot, alerting him to his latest findings: &#8220;I have myself been thinking since I got your note about this enigma&#8230; . If the whole of the unreduced Chloride be </span><em>washed out</em> of </span><em>the paper</em> which may be done </span><em>instantaneously</em> and </span><em>to the last atom</em> by a process I have discovered &#8212; leaving the reduced silver still on the paper in the form of a fine Brown or Sepia tint &#8212; our picture becomes permanent.&#8221; Herschel then revised this letter, adding in a postscript to the second version that &#8220;on trial the Hyposulphite appears to answer perfectly the end.&#8221;</span><a href="#note13" id="marker13"><sup>13</sup></a> So it was that on Friday, February 1, 1839, Talbot, carrying his &#8220;Camera Obscura pictures&#8221;</span><a href="#note14" id="marker14"><sup>14</sup></a> with him, took a day-return ticket on the new train down to Slough.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p>Herschel&#8217;s work with &#8220;hypo,&#8221; Talbot discovered, did indeed answer &#8220;perfectly the end&#8221; and was a vital contribution to the progress of this as yet unnamed art. Moreover, in contrast to Daguerre, who was preoccupied with secrecy, Herschel had no reservations about sharing his discovery of the fixing process. He permitted Talbot to make the findings public, with the result that following their publication by the French Academy of Sciences, hypo was picked up by Daguerre himself.</span><a href="#note15" id="marker15"><sup>15</sup></a> Today, Herschel is also credited with coming up with the umbrella term used to describe the work of both Daguerre and Talbot&#8212;</span><em>photography</em>&#8212;a word that would be formalized by Talbot a couple of years later in a public letter to the </span><em>Literary Gazette</em>. And in May 1839, just three months after Talbot&#8217;s visit to Slough, Herschel was one of the few British scientists invited by Arago to go to Paris to see what it was that Daguerre had produced.</span></p>
			<p>It&#8217;s hard, then, to imagine that when Talbot received Herschel&#8217;s letter from France he could have been as enthused as his friend was by the evident superiority of the daguerreotype. But one thing, at least, was finally clear to everybody: the two processes, English and French, were very different.</p>

			<h3>Photography and the View from the Country&#160;House</h3>
			<p>Let&#8217;s return for a moment to February 1, 1839, and the afternoon of Talbot&#8217;s visit to Slough to show Herschel his &#8220;specimens.&#8221; Although the winter weather was miserable, 1839 was shaping up to be an interesting time for an English gentleman of leisure with solid financial resources. A new and young queen was on the throne; the empire was expanding; change was in the air. Despite the economy&#8217;s having slowed in recent years, trade and travel had been energized in the late 1830s due in part to new and more time-efficient modes of transportation such as steamboats and the railroad. Interest rates were rising, though soon the government would cut them, leading to increased investment in more profitable private railway futures. There was no sign yet of the overheated market of the mid-1840s that would lead to the collapse of the railway bubble and widespread financial ruin for thousands. Politically as well as financially, it was a time of reform and change &#8212; and of dissent regarding those changes and resistance to many of them. The previous year, the Chartist movement had failed in its lobbying effort to extend voting rights to all males and for annual elections to be held for the House of Commons, though those changes were eventually to be made later in the century. Talbot himself was a moderate reformer, largely sympathetic to the Whig party, and had served as a member of Parliament for Chippenham between 1832 and 1835, so if he had picked up a newspaper to read on the train, he might have been interested in following that day&#8217;s political events.</p>
			<p>He certainly had a far greater choice among publications than ever before, as reduced tariffs on stamps and paper continued to lower the production costs of daily publications. We know that he was a regular reader of weeklies such as the<em> Literary Gazette</em> and the <em>Athenaeum</em>. For daily news coverage, however, he would likely have had a copy of the<em> Times</em>, a newspaper that began circulating in 1785 as the <em>Daily Universal Register</em>. If he had the paper with him on the ride to Slough, he might well have been following the stories it contained on some of those reforms that had been pushed through earlier in the decade during his tenure in Parliament.</p>
			<p>There was plenty of political interest to read about that particular day, including an account of the consequences of the new Poor Law as well as an article about a recent gathering of concerned parties to discuss the state of the current Corn Laws. There was a lengthy piece on the coal trade, with an account of a recent dinner hosted by the Newcastle chamber of commerce, attended by the mayor, several members of Parliament, and various wealthy owners and investors. Talbot might also have been interested in reading about a &#8220;curious telegraphic system&#8221;<a href="#note16" id="marker16"><sup>16</sup></a> tried out the previous week in Paris, or about Queen Victoria&#8217;s recent private visit to the theater at Drury Lane to see the famous American wild-animal trainer, Mr. Van Amburgh, feed his animals on the stage. In the London law courts, owners of premises in Lower Thames Street were petitioning against extending the Blackwall railway as far as Fenchurch Street, while the <em>Monthly Chronicle</em> was bringing a copyright suit against a new magazine, the <em>Railway Times,</em> over an article published the month before. Over at the Admiralty, the court was considering the case of the <em>Aline</em>, a Russian schooner with a cargo of flax, which had collided in the channel with the <em>Panther</em>, a brig with a cargo of oil sailing from Gallipoli to Saint Petersburg.</p>
			<p>The financial news that day was good: there was &#8220;no fluctuation of any consequence in the funds,&#8221; and railway shares were stable; news of the failure of some cotton houses in Manchester had apparently not affected the wider market. Cotton prices in Liverpool were &#8220;without change<span> &#8230; </span>mostly steady.&#8221; In the classifieds, the China Tea Company was reducing its prices, as was the East India Tea Company; coal remained steady, between twenty-nine and thirty shillings a ton. Textiles from the northern mills, as well as imported linens and general haberdashery, were on offer: &#8220;Moravian, Trafalgar and French embroidery cottons&#8221; along with &#8220;knitting and netting cottons, Taylor&#8217;s Persian thread on reels, netting silks, Berlin patterns and wools.&#8221;</p>
			<p>If Talbot looked at the births and deaths that day, he might not have noticed, as a twenty-first-century reader does, the relative youth of those who had just died, or that the cause of death of the sixteen-year-old daughter of the American consul in London was consumption, a disease that would become familiar to the post-Victorian world largely through the pages of novels that were mostly yet to be written. There is no mention of Dickens in the </span><em>Times</em> that day, though he was well known by 1839 and already feeling decidedly overextended. He had published </span><em>Oliver Twist</em> the year before, and with too many writing commitments on his desk, had decided just that past Monday to resign his editorship at </span><em>Bentley&#8217;s Miscellany</em> in order to finish up </span><em>Nicholas Nickleby</em> and make some progress with </span><em>Barnaby Rudge </em>(</span>for which he had to beg a six-month extension). Dickens&#8217;s future literary rival William Thackeray was working as a lowly reviewer for the </span><em>Times</em>, but in that day&#8217;s book column the focus was not on fiction but on the just-released twelfth volume of the Duke of Wellington&#8217;s dispatches, allowing the anonymous reviewer (Thackeray?) to indulge in some unabashed hero worship. Wellington (pl. 9) was for many Victorians the embodiment of glorious military history, and he provided a living link between the modern age and what was beginning to feel like the distant past of the Napoleonic Wars. Jane Austen was long dead. The Battle of Waterloo, to be fictionalized later by Thackeray in his best-selling historical novel </span><em>Vanity Fair</em>, already seemed to belong to another age.</span></p>
			<p>Maybe Talbot skipped the book review to look at the society pages: the Duke of Cambridge had gone to Kew Park the day before for a day&#8217;s shooting; Viscount Melbourne and Lord Hill had held audiences with the queen. Charles Darwin&#8217;s marriage earlier in the week did not make the news that day, though in 1839 his name probably didn&#8217;t ring much of a bell for Talbot. Paul C&#233;zanne had also just been born, though Talbot wouldn&#8217;t have seen that particular birth announcement in the </span><em>Times</em>, any more than he would have paid attention to the birth later that year of Walter Pater, future aesthete and literary role model for the future Oscar Wilde. In April 1839, just two months away, the world&#8217;s first commercial electric telegraph line would come into operation. In July, slaves aboard the </span><em>Amistad</em> would rebel and capture the ship. Also in July of that year, the First Anglo-Afghan War would begin, as would, in September, the first Anglo-Chinese Opium War.</span></p>
			<p> Of course, it&#8217;s possible that Talbot did not read the newspaper at all, but rather looked out the window and experienced the novelty of the train ride. The public railway had been founded in 1825 and only very recently connected London with that part of Buckinghamshire where Herschel lived. The countryside, it seemed, was getting closer to town. One might now make in an hour a journey that had previously taken half a day or more; for the first time, one could, as Talbot did that afternoon, run down to Slough, stay for dinner, and return to London by train the same day. The speed with which it was possible to move through space on land and sea meant that distances were in effect getting smaller. By 1852 the travel time between London and Scotland would lessen so significantly that Queen Victoria could regard the Highlands as a holiday destination and purchase a residence there.</p>
			<p>Whereas the reach of empire was expanding, as the many newspaper notices of docking and departing ships attested, it </span><em>felt</em> as though geographical distances were shrinking and the rest of the world was coming closer.</span></p>
			<p>On a grander scale, through refinements in the telescope during the eighteenth century, previously unknown star clusters were being cataloged, and the 1830s (1839 in particular) saw fierce competition among astronomers to calculate with greater precision interstellar distances. Scientific achievement had never seemed more extraordinary or, literally, so far-reaching. At the same time, geological theories concerning the age of the world and the circumstances of its coming into being rendered human beings ever smaller in the history of the cosmos. The vastness of the universe in time and space challenged the religious and philosophical certainties of many nineteenth-century minds.</p>
			<p>One who had already made a contribution to the conceptual shrinking of space, by building a new kind of telescope in 1816, was John Herschel. In January 1839, as his letters to Talbot suggest, he was suffering from the dreariness of the English winter weather after having spent the previous five years in South Africa charting the night sky of the Southern Hemisphere. When Herschel returned to England in 1838, he received a baronetcy for his contributions to human knowledge and settled comfortably back into the life of an educated gentleman with scientific interests. When Talbot visited him in Slough that Friday afternoon, Herschel had spent all week in the country, pursuing his experiments there just as Talbot liked to do in his own study at Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire.</p>
			<p>It&#8217;s worth pausing Talbot&#8217;s train just a little longer to acknowledge the social context in which photography in England came into being. That context &#8212; the small world of the leisured and educated classes, with private incomes and comfortable establishments, equipped with studies and libraries in country and town &#8212; was considerably less mobile and subject to change than the busy new world documented by the </span><em>Times</em>, a world of commerce, industry, financial speculation, and technological innovation into which many Victorians felt themselves to be moving at alarming speed. Yet the earliest photographs betray little evidence of an unstable or shifting world, all the changes underway in the 1840s notwithstanding. For the first decade of photography&#8217;s existence, it was what we might call the &#8220;view from the country house&#8221; &#8212; orderly, serene, pleasing &#8212; that provided subjects for the camera and gave history its first glimpses of Victorian life.</span></p>
			<p>We don&#8217;t know what images Herschel shared with Talbot, but we do know that Talbot&#8217;s included not only those tracings of lace and leaves that had so charmed his sister-in-law but also a number of pictures of his house. These had been made with cameras of varying sizes (his wife referred to these wood boxes as &#8220;mousetraps&#8221;</span><a href="#note17" id="marker17"><sup>17</sup></a>) and, Talbot warned Herschel, were very different from the life-size &#8220;copies,&#8221; or photograms: &#8220;The Camera Obscura pictures which I will shew you are Lilliputian ones,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;&#38; require a lens to look at them.&#8221;</span><a href="#note18" id="marker18"><sup>18</sup></a> They were &#8220;very perfect but extremely small.&#8221; It was these pictures that most excited Talbot. Indeed, he had, as he noted in his paper delivered earlier that week to the Royal Society, made &#8220;a great number of representations of my house in the country,&#8221; adding the now-famous assertion that &#8220;this building I believe to be the first that was ever yet known </span><em>to have drawn its own picture.</em>&#8221;</span><a href="#note19" id="marker19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
			<p>The first house to have &#8220;drawn its own picture&#8221; was not just any house but the thirteenth-century seat of an aristocratic family.</span><a href="#note20" id="marker20"><sup>20</sup></a> Lacock Abbey had, as Talbot said in his paper, &#8220;ancient and remarkable architecture&#8221; and was &#8220;well suited&#8221; to photography. Why well suited? For one thing, early photography, as Lady Elizabeth Eastlake was later to note, was very successful at representing old things, rough surfaces, antique textures.</span><a href="#note21" id="marker21"><sup>21</sup></a> But presumably Talbot also thought Lacock Abbey to be suited to photography because it was worth documenting. It represented a piece of English history and was valuable because it embodied continuity with an ancient past. A silent witness and backdrop to many religious and cultural changes of the previous six centuries, Lacock Abbey was significant for the nation&#8217;s identity, now and in the future.</span></p>
			<p>Talbot later published twenty-four of his images in a limited and pricey series, with a brief account of the history of his discovery.</span><em> The Pencil of Nature</em> (1844&#8211;46) suggests some of the subjects the photographer found to be picture worthy: timeworn architecture in Oxford, Paris, and Orl&#233;ans; the tower and cloisters of Lacock Abbey </span>(</span>fig. 4</span>); and objects Talbot had, as it were, lying around the house: glass, china, a bust of Patroclus </span>(</span>fig. 5</span>), books, and a page from one of those books &#8220;containing the statutes of Richard the Second, written in Norman French.&#8221;</span><a href="#note22" id="marker22"><sup>22</sup></a> These were not just any glass or china, then, and not just any book, either, but rather objects that merited a photograph; they demonstrated historical and family connection. The social world inhabited by Talbot and Herschel, and the material world represented in British photography&#8217;s earliest images, rested upon the transfer of traditionalist values. Unsurprisingly, photography&#8217;s first practitioners in Britain &#8212; amateurs, enthusiasts, ladies and gentlemen of leisure &#8212; chose to photograph objects whose associations were of family, national history, continuity, stability, and transcendence. The world to which those image-objects belong is the world of Lacock Abbey and other grand houses like it, houses from which the view is as curious and as charming, but arguably as unrepresentative of the larger world, as Lilliput.</span></p>

			<h3>From Lacock Abbey to Buckingham Palace</h3>
			<p>Lady Elisabeth Feilding (1773&#8211;1846; fig. 6), was a woman of strong opinions, and one of them was that her son, Henry Talbot, should become famous for his inventions. Writing to him in February 1839, Lady Elisabeth congratulated Talbot and his wife, Constance, on the recent birth of their new daughter but moved swiftly to the real purpose of her letter: &#8220;I was quite surprized at your making the secret of the Photogenic Drawing known, it precludes entirely all chance of your making <em>your fortune</em> by selling it as M. Daguerre intended or getting a patent.&#8221; Of the new arrival, she added in closing that &#8220;Horatia [Henry&#8217;s half sister] proposes her name should be <em>Iodine</em> in honor of your discovery.&#8221;<a href="#note23" id="marker23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

Talbot sent her packets of samples for her friends. &#8220;People pillage me dreadfully,&#8221; she wrote in response. &#8220;I was obliged to give some of my worst to Julia Sheffield because I really could not spare any more of the best&#8230; .

			</div>
			<p>Talbot&#8217;s discovery was all the rage among the country-house set, with both women and men taking up the new hobby. Even Constance Talbot, whose letters betray little interest in photography, worked anxiously to master the printing process so as to answer her husband&#8217;s frequent requests from town for more samples of his work. Meanwhile, her mother-in-law, Lady Elisabeth, was determined to get the pictures into the most aristocratic hands, and with family connections it was surprisingly easy for her to accomplish this. Talbot&#8217;s cousin Theresa Digby was a &#8220;Woman of the Bedchamber&#8221; at Buckingham Palace, officially Queen Victoria&#8217;s London residence since her accession to the throne two years earlier. On April 8, 1839, Theresa wrote to tell Talbot that his half sister Caroline had sent her &#8220;an attempt at a Photogenic drawing&#8221; and that she had duly shown it to the queen, &#8220;who was very much interested with it.&#8221; Naturally, Theresa now wanted Henry to send along something better: &#8220;I should like exceedingly for her to see something more worth looking at, and if you could send me one of your own doing I should be very much obliged.&#8221;<a href="#note29" id="marker29"><sup>29</sup></a> Talbot acceded, sending some images to town from Lacock Abbey, which his mother then gave to their footman to deliver (&#8220;Wright took your Photogenics to the Palace,&#8221;<a href="#note30" id="marker30"><sup>30</sup></a> she informed her son). A week later he got this encouraging response from Theresa:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Many thanks for the drawings which I showed to the Queen yesterday evening after dinner, they met with universal admiration from a large party; I am sorry to tell you that the Queen was more struck by the exactness of the similitude of the <em>ribbon</em>, than the beauty of the ferns &#38; grasses, the gauze ribbon she said was <em>very curious</em>, and she must try to do some herself.<a href="#note31" id="marker31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Lady Elisabeth was, of course, inclined to pursue the opening: &#8220;I understand the Queen being no Botanist admires </span><em>most</em> the riband you sent her. Therefore I have [a] mind to send you a bit of beautiful Point Lace which I think would have great success &#8212; shall I? I wish you would send me some more to lay on my table. Louisa has a vast number of Morning visitors expressly to see them.&#8221;</span><a href="#note32" id="marker32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
			<p>By April 1839 the circle of interested persons had expanded to include not only the queen but also European royalty. Lady Elisabeth could hardly contain herself with the news that a &#8220;Dr Hamel&#8221; from Hamburg had been in touch with her to get some images to send to Russia &#8220;for the Emperor&#8217;s second son, a very scientific young Man. He wishes to lay some before the Czarowitch.&#8221;</span><a href="#note33" id="marker33"><sup>33</sup></a> And Queen Victoria&#8217;s interest in Talbot&#8217;s work continued; indeed, Elizabeth Heyert makes the appealing claim that during the queen&#8217;s proposal of marriage to Prince Albert on October 15, 1839, &#8220;to allay her nervousness, she talked to him first about Daguerre&#8217;s newly published invention.&#8221;</span><a href="#note34" id="marker34"><sup>34</sup></a> According to Victoria&#8217;s diary, in March 1842 her husband posed for his own daguerreotype while the couple was staying in Brighton (see fig. 39).</span><a href="#note35" id="marker35"><sup>35</sup></a> In November 1843, Lady Elisabeth wrote to Talbot that her daughter Caroline, his half sister, now a lady-in-waiting at the palace, had &#8220;shewed those little Talbotypes you sent her lately to the Queen Sunday Evg, who was so delighted with them that C. thought herself obliged to offer them, &#38; C. is to stick them into the Album you gave the Q. Her majesty sent for her magnifying glass to inspect them.&#8221;</span><a href="#note36" id="marker36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

			<p>Despite Lady Elisabeth&#8217;s triumph in her son&#8217;s successes with the palace, she was still inclined to focus on the lost opportunity of, first, securing a fortune through the invention and, second, claiming a place in history for the family name. When she learned, via the </span><em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, that a four-foot-long calotype had been made of &#8220;one of the most important documents of Modern times, the Treaty of Peace with the Emperor of China,&#8221; she was incensed. &#8220;One copy is ordered for the Queen, to be framed &#38; glazed &#38; hung up at Buckingham Palace,&#8221; she quoted from the paper in a letter to her son. &#8220;Why did not </span><em>you</em> do this for her Majesty?&#8221;</span><a href="#note37" id="marker37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

			<h3>Photographic Portraiture</h3>
			<p>From the excited and vibrant correspondence among Talbot&#8217;s friends and family, it would seem that the invention of photography answered a long-felt need, and the potential to record human beings was almost immediately a subject for speculation. Of course, the aristocracy had always had visual access to its family past through the skills of portrait painters. In the spring of 1838, Constance Talbot had in fact been much preoccupied with having the artist and drawing teacher Robert Forster paint the small Talbot girls (&#8220;Ela cannot possibly look better or more animated than she does at present &#8212; so I think this is a favorable moment for taking her picture&#8221;).<a href="#note38" id="marker38"><sup>38</sup></a> Her brother, as she wrote to her husband in town, &#8220;lately had <em>his</em> picture painted by Ross the famous Miniature painter.&#8221;<a href="#note39" id="marker39"><sup>39</sup></a> But portraits of any size were pricey. In the same letter, after Forster was hired and at work on the portraits, Constance added, somewhat nervously: &#8220;I ought to have told you that Mr. Forster&#8217;s charge for children&#8217;s picture is from 2 to 3 guineas each figure.&#8221;</p>
			<p>Aside from Mr. Forster&#8217;s fee, Constance&#8217;s greatest concern was for verisimilitude: the portraits, to be successful, must look like their subjects. The degree of success obviously depended upon the skills of the artist. But with the advent of photography, perfect resemblance seemed at last to be within reach in every portrait. As Talbot himself reflected: &#8220;What would not be the value to our English Nobility of such a record of their ancestors who lived a century ago? On how small a portion of their family picture galleries can they really rely with confidence!&#8221;<a href="#note40" id="marker40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
			<p><span>A more obvious rhetorical question for the modern reader appears not to have occurred to Talbot. &#8220;What would not be the value&#8221; to </span><em>all</em><span> people of a &#8220;record of their ancestors&#8221;? For while Lacock Abbey, like Buckingham Palace &#8212; or, indeed, like Margam Hall, or Penrice, or Penllergare, all great country estates owned by Talbot&#8217;s extended family &#8212; contained its own valuable (if unreliable) records, in the shape of miniatures, sketches, and oil paintings representing generations of family forebears, the vast majority of people had never had access to representations of family likenesses in any form. On the first page of Dickens&#8217;s </span><em>Great Expectations </em><span>(1861), Pip tells the reader: &#8220;As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them </span><span>(</span><span>for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their tombstones.&#8221;</span><a href="#note41" id="marker41"><sup>41</sup></a><span> The idea that photography might address the posthumous invisibility of working people was tantalizing; as the</span><em> Edinburgh Review </em><span>noted in 1843, &#8220;where the magic names of kindred and home are inscribed, what a deep interest do the realities of photography excite!&#8221;</span><a href="#note42" id="marker42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
			<p>Yet for all its appeal as an idea, portrait photography did not seem feasible. In 1839 and 1840, photography was expensive and time-consuming, a pleasant occupation only for those with leisure and funds to spare; but the process was also unsuited for making portraits because of the length of time it took to secure an image. Talbot&#8217;s cameras were set up outdoors for thirty to ninety minutes at a stretch, and the results depended largely on the quality of light, a problem that the British weather did little to resolve (much of Talbot&#8217;s correspondence makes mention of clouds, overcast skies, and generally unhelpful conditions; Herschel laments that he didn&#8217;t take up photography while he was in South Africa). Daguerreotypes were similarly slow to produce, requiring fifteen to thirty minutes under good lighting conditions. As much as portraiture seemed the next, highly desirable step in photography&#8217;s evolution, it was impossible to keep a living subject still long enough to produce an effective likeness.<a href="#note43" id="marker43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
			<p>Desire for portraits, however, inspired experimentation among opticians and chemists in both America and Europe and indeed largely drove the rapid innovations that soon changed both Talbot&#8217;s and Daguerre&#8217;s processes. By the end of 1839 a first, early mention of success arrived in a letter from the astronomer and mathematician John William Lubbock (1803&#8211;1865) to Talbot, with the unverified news that &#8220;Daguerre has done a portrait of himself, said to be excellent.&#8221;</span><a href="#note44" id="marker44"><sup>44</sup></a> This would still have been impossible for Talbot, but by September 1840, perhaps motivated in part by that report of his rival&#8217;s progress, he had a significant breakthrough, with a refinement in technique that greatly diminished required exposure times. As Talbot informed readers of the </span><em>Literary Gazette</em>, &#8220;a much better picture can now be obtained in a </span><em>minute</em> than by the former process in </span><em>an hour</em>. This increased rapidity is accompanied with an increased sharpness and distinctness in the outlines of the objects.&#8221; On both counts, then &#8212; time and clarity of focus &#8212; Talbot&#8217;s new calotype process meant that &#8220;the art has now reached a point which is likely to make it extensively useful.&#8221; And, he added, &#8220;one of the most important applications of the new process, and most likely to prove generally interesting, is, undoubtedly, the taking of portraits. I made trial of it last October, and found that the experiment readily succeeded. Half a minute appeared to be sufficient in sunshine, and four or five minutes when a person was seated in the shade.&#8221;</span><a href="#note45" id="marker45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
			<p>Daguerreotypists were similarly eager to master portraiture. During the same month that Talbot managed to reduce exposure times, Antoine Claudet (1797&#8211;1867), a French glassmaker working in London, made progress using chlorine as well as iodine to increase the light sensitivity of the copper plates employed in daguerreotypy.</span><a href="#note46" id="marker46"><sup>46</sup></a> He launched almost immediately into competition with Richard Beard (1802&#8211;1888), a coal merchant and inventor, who controlled the daguerreotype patent rights in England </span>(</span>for which he had paid the high sum of eight hundred pounds, an investment that was to pay off extraordinarily well). Beard had already set up a partnership with two Americans, Alexander Woolcott and John Johnson (d. 1871), making use of a new American mirror camera that reduced the time required for a sitting to a more tolerable &#8220;one to four minutes.&#8221;</span><a href="#note47" id="marker47"><sup>47</sup></a> Both Beard and Claudet rapidly opened portrait studios in London &#8212; the former in March 1841, and the latter in June the same year &#8212; and competition for customers began.</span></p>
			<p>The subject of portraiture immediately surged to the fore of public consciousness. Elizabeth Barrett Browning probably spoke for many with her words to Mary Russell Mitford, who was among the first to have her picture taken:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I long to have such a memorial of every being dear to me in the world. It is not merely the likeness which is precious in such cases &#8212; but the association and the sense of nearness involved in the thing &#8230; the fact of the very shadow of the person lying there fixed forever! It is the very sanctification of portraits I think &#8212; and it is not at all monstrous in me to say &#8230; that I would rather have such a memorial of one I dearly loved, than the noblest artist&#8217;s work ever produced.&#8221;<a href="#note48" id="marker48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In October 1840 the Edinburgh scientist David Brewster (1781&#8211;1868) wrote with gratitude for some &#8220;specimens&#8221; Talbot had sent him, but confessed, &#8220;I long for a Portrait.&#8221;</span><a href="#note49" id="marker49"><sup>49</sup></a> Talbot at once obliged, and Brewster found that the two &#8220;very fine&#8221; portraits sent on loan to him as evidence &#8220;show what may be expected from the Art.&#8221;</span><a href="#note50" id="marker50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
			<p>That &#8220;Art&#8221; was the appropriate term to describe the calotype seems to have been the consensus among its earliest enthusiasts. Photograms, calotypes, and daguerreotypes were frequently described in the early days as &#8220;drawings&#8221; or &#8220;sketches,&#8221; with the meaningful point of reference being, obviously, painting. Indeed, some of photography&#8217;s first admirers seemed initially to believe that the camera had somehow painted the image before them. Certainly it was widely held among Talbot&#8217;s peers that the aim of photography was to improve upon painting by imitating its accomplishment. Photography&#8217;s place among the visual arts was later to be contested, but its earliest practitioners remained profoundly interested in its aesthetic power. The Reverend George Butler, Talbot&#8217;s old headmaster from his school days at Harrow, begged his former pupil to turn his invention to work on &#8220;drawings of Forest Trees, the oak, Elm, Beech, &#38;c,&#8221; as this would be &#8220;the greatest stride towards effective drawing &#38; painting that has been made for a Century.&#8221;</span><a href="#note51" id="marker51"><sup>51</sup></a> The scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802&#8211;1875), the future inventor of the stereoscope, wrote to Talbot: &#8220;Your new photograph excited much interest at the Marquis&#8217; on Saturday. The artists generally greatly prefered [</span><em>sic</em>] it to the more elaborately finished Daguerotype [</span><em>sic</em>] portraits which were also exhibited there. One academician said it was equal in effect to any thing of Sir Joshua&#8217;s&#8221;</span> [Reynolds].</span><a href="#note52" id="marker52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
			<p>Photography&#8217;s early status as art, however, or as a practice with artistic potential, was probably due as much to its initial social context as to its aesthetic accomplishment. It was a diversion for the well connected, a pursuit with aristocratic and scientific associations. During the early 1840s those associations were strengthened, no doubt in part by Queen Victoria&#8217;s interest. Photography was, as the Reverend George Wilson Bridges noted in a letter to Talbot, &#8220;certainly an aristocratic art,&#8221; and it looked as if it might remain so, since the reverend was hardly alone in finding it &#8220;rather expensive.&#8221;</span><a href="#note53" id="marker53"><sup>53</sup></a> &#8220;Lady Blanche Hyems,&#8221; wrote the humorist Cuthbert Bede,</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>assures me that she considers Photography to be <em>par excellence</em> the scientific amusement of the higher classes&#8230; . For the present at any rate, Photography has the patronage of aristocratic &#8212; may we not add, Royal? &#8212; amateurs. It has not yet become too common; nor indeed is it likely to become so. The <em>profanum vulgus</em> keep aloof from it; it is too expensive a pastime for the commonalty. And, whatever the progress of the invention may do toward cheapening the apparatus required by the Photographer, yet, I am inclined to believe that, at present it is only people with long purses who can afford to take up Calotyping as an amusement. And, more than this, it is only people with plenty of spare time on their hands who can afford to pay attention to it.<a href="#note54" id="marker54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>For all Bede&#8217;s satirical tone, he was accurate in his observation that photography remained not just a cumbersome but a pricey hobby &#8212; a fact that limited its wider use throughout the 1840s, despite Reverend Bridges&#8217;s sentiment that it was, of all the arts, &#8220;the most astonishing of modern times.&#8221;</span><a href="#note55" id="marker55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

			<h3>The Widening Circle</h3>
			<p>As the making of both daguerreotypes and calotypes became more widely understood and practiced, and as the evolution of both processes led to better results, advertisements in the<em> Times</em> and other papers began to offer a variety of competing services <span>(</span><span>fig. 9</span>), such as &#8220;coloured and non-inverted daguerreotype portraits&#8221; or &#8220;a separate room for ladies, with the attendance of a respectable female.&#8221; These notices, running daily in the classifieds of major newspapers during the 1840s, were evidence of small refinements in photography, such as hand tinting, that had come into vogue around the same time that the issue of image reversal in daguerreotypes had been resolved. Photography&#8217;s first professional &#8220;operators,&#8221; aiming at a high-end market, stressed respectability, legality (patent cases regarding the daguerreotype were frequently in the press), speed, and likeness. &#8220;The sitting does not exceed half a minute,&#8221; assured one advertisement, adding that &#8220;the portrait is a stamp of the original, and produces in effect a second self.&#8221;<a href="#note56" id="marker56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

			</div>
			<p>Prices continued to be high. Claudet, who advertised his services in the <em>Times</em> in both kinds of photography, charged from one to four guineas for his daguerreotypes, and one guinea for a calotype portrait the size of half a sheet of letter paper (4<span>3/4</span> <span>&#215; </span>6<span>1/2</span> in., or 12.1 <span>&#215; </span>16.5 cm) &#8212; and seven shillings sixpence for every extra copy. Beard charged two guineas for one daguerreotype sitting (approximately what Constance Talbot in 1838 was expecting to pay for her daughters&#8217; painted portraits). Lesser-known photographers were more affordable, though for the most part they could stay in business only if they were able to avoid paying the licensing fees. The price of a quarter-plate daguerreotype (3<span>1/4</span> <span>&#215; </span>4<span>1/4</span> in., or 8.3 <span>&#215; </span>10.8 cm) was estimated by the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> in 1843 at &#8220;five or six shillings.&#8221;<a href="#note57" id="marker57"><sup>57</sup></a> Cases and frames, however, were ornate and expensive, and even the smallest pictures remained out of reach for many working people.<a href="#note58" id="marker58"><sup>58</sup></a> The limitations put on British photographers as a result of patents on both the daguerreotype and calotype significantly limited photography&#8217;s use and kept prices high.</p>
			<p>In America, by contrast, there was no patent to contend with. A daguerreotype made in New York was initially not cheap &#8212; according to the photographer and historian Bill Jay, the cost of a sixth plate (3<span>3/4</span> <span>&#215; </span>3<span>1/4</span> in., or 9.5 <span>&#215; </span>8.3 cm) was about five dollars, which in the 1840s might be a week&#8217;s wage for the average American worker.<sup> 59</sup> However, within just a few years, demand became so high that thousands of picture-making establishments opened across the United States. Prices were pushed down and production soared. Thus while in 1852 there were, according to Elizabeth Eastlake in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, only seven officially listed photographers in the London directory,<a href="#note60" id="marker60"><sup>60</sup></a> in New York the previous year, according to the <em>Scientific American</em>, there were &#8220;127 operators, and thousands upon thousands of pictures &#8230; taken every year.&#8221;<a href="#note61" id="marker61"><sup>61</sup></a> Americans were clearly as enthusiastic about photography as their European counterparts. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, three of the five medals awarded for daguerreotypes were won by Americans.<a href="#note62" id="marker62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
			<p>Despite its enormous popularity, the daguerreotype was to be relatively short-lived. Daguerreotypes were delicate and easily broken, and more significantly, they could not easily be reproduced. Although Talbot&#8217;s calotype process never achieved the remarkable precision of detail permitted by the daguerreotype, the possibility of reproducing the images secured its longevity. Throughout the 1840s many photographers also enjoyed the aesthetically pleasing depth and gentleness of tone that seemed to ally the paper process more overtly with artistic practices.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, and presumably following Daguerre&#8217;s lead, Talbot set about trying to prosecute any unauthorized calotype practice. At 100 to 150 pounds per year, Talbot&#8217;s licensing fee was no small sum, but as the practice of photography expanded, prosecution became impossible for Talbot to pursue, and profits were slim. Lady Elisabeth policed the classifieds, bemoaning the various ways in which photographic operators were attempting to bypass or circumvent the patenting restrictions, bringing photography in effect within reach of the middle class. &#8220;My Dear Henry,&#8221; she wrote on September 15, 1844,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Have you seen an advertisement which professes to sell at No 98 Cheapside not only photographic cameras, but iodine boxes, bromine pans, iodized paper &#38; every chemical preparation &#38; apparatus required in Photography, with full instruction given to purchasers, &#38; shortly will be published <em>Plain</em> directions for obtaining Pictures <em>on Paper</em> by the Calotype Process. How can they do all this without a licence from you? Claudet I see advertises the Talbotype Portraits almost every day in the <em>Times</em>.<a href="#note63" id="marker63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The problem of patent infringement was soon resolved for all sides. In 1851 the wet collodion process invented by Frederick Scott Archer (1813&#8211;1857) came onto the market unhampered by any licensing fees. Archer&#8217;s process, in which negatives were developed on glass, produced sharper images and clearer details than the calotype, and it was cheaper and easier to use than the daguerreotype. Multiple images could be made from wet collodion negatives. Talbot&#8217;s initial efforts later that year to sue a photographer for using the wet collodion process without a calotype license, based on his conviction that he owned the rights to the negative-positive process, were unsuccessful, and he must have realized by this point that any financial stake he might once have had in photography&#8217;s unforeseeable future was evaporating. In 1852, after members of the Royal Society appealed to him on behalf of the many photographers who felt themselves unduly burdened by his licensing fee, Talbot agreed to abandon his claims.</p>
			<p>From 1851 until 1880 wet collodion dominated photographic practices everywhere. In Britain, with the expiration of patents, photographic studios opened in almost every town, and prices went down significantly. By 1857 photography was, as Elizabeth Eastlake put it,</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>a household word and a household want; &#8230; used alike by art and science, by love, business, and justice; &#8230; found in the most sumptuous saloon, and in the dingiest attic &#8212; in the solitude of the Highland cottage, and in the glare of the London gin-palace&#8212;in the pocket of the detective, in the cell of the convict, in the folio of the painter and architect, among the papers and patterns of the millowner and manufacturer, and on the cold brave breast on the battle-field.&#8221;<a href="#note64" id="marker64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>From Buckingham Palace to the London gin palace, photography, it seemed, at last belonged to everyone.</p>

			<h3>Photography and Other Arts</h3>
			<p>If there is one thing that unites early and late discussion of photography, it is the issue of truthfulness. Most of the first comments on photography were excited responses to its extraordinary accuracy and, at least initially, its perceived inability to lie. The likeness that Constance Talbot sought in the paintings of her children was guaranteed by the camera; it is small wonder that visual artists were quick to make use of photography in drafting their own work (or that they were less quick to acknowledge photography&#8217;s assistance). The work of the Pre-Raphaelites is a case in point. We know that Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828&#8211;1882) posed Jane Morris for photographs <span>(</span><span>fig. 10</span>) and used the results in his portrait work <span>(</span><span>fig. 11</span>); the results are striking. Michael Bartram tells us that &#8220;John Everett Millais from the mid-1850s onward, relied more and more on photography for landscape backgrounds and portraits,&#8221; whereas the lesser known Atkinson Grimshaw &#8220;secretly painted over photographs.&#8221;<a href="#note65" id="marker65"><sup>65</sup></a> The artist William Powell Frith (1819&#8211;1909) was publicly no fan of the Pre-Raphaelites, but like them he benefited from photographs that helped him draft his paintings. <em>The Derby Day</em> <span>(</span><span>fig. 12</span>), arguably his best-known work, made use of photographs by Robert Howlett (1831&#8211;1858) that Frith had commissioned of the grandstand and groups of people <span>(</span><span>fig. 13</span>). The <em>Photographic News</em> reported a couple of years later that &#8220;Mr. Samuel Fry has recently been engaged in taking a series of negatives, 25 inches by 18 inches, and 10 inches by 8 inches, of the interior of the Great Western Station, engines, carriages, etc. for Mr. Frith, as aids to the production of his great painting &#8216;Life at a Railway Station.&#8217; Such is the value of the photograph in aiding the artist&#8217;s work, that he wonders now however they did without them!&#8221;<a href="#note66" id="marker66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

			<p> It is noteworthy not so much that painters used photography, or even that on occasion they kept the practice quiet, but that the look of photography was the desired effect. In large part because of the obsessive preoccupation with detail, many Victorian paintings seem to promise that through looking the world can be known. The implied viewer of these works has a powerful, godlike eye. Indeed, the relationship realist paintings celebrate between knowledge and vision is in many ways the defining characteristic of the earliest daguerreotypes and speaks to their epistemological as well as aesthetic appeal. Herschel&#8217;s delight in 1839 at the revelations of a magnifying glass held up to a daguerreotype was a delight in scale but also in a world revealed &#8212; a world, in other words, that might be </span><em>known</em>.</span></p>
			<p>The truthfulness of photography, of course, was not always welcome. In a humorous piece of doggerel, Lewis Carroll recorded the difficulties of trying to take a portrait of a family in which beauty was apparently lacking. After numerous failures at making individual portraits, the photographer, &#8220;Hiawatha,&#8221;</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Tumbled all the tribe together,<br />
				(&#8220;Grouped&#8221; is not the right expression),<br />
				And, as happy chance would have it,<br />
				Did at last obtain a picture<br />
				Where the faces all succeeded:<br />
				Each came out a perfect likeness.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Naturally, nobody is pleased with this result. Carroll continues:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then they joined and all abused it,<br />
				Unrestrainedly abused it,<br />
				As the worst and ugliest picture<br />
				They could possibly have dreamed of.</span><a href="#note67" id="marker67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>As one might expect, the photographer makes a number of appearances in popular fiction of the age, represented in some cases as an outsider, as a worker of magic or science who is socially marginalized (though at times, through his association with the arts, within the boundaries of acceptability). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was deeply interested in photography&#8217;s capacity for truth as well as illusion, and Sherlock Holmes is wise to its potential. Thomas Hardy used photographs in a number of his novels to indicate the social aspirations of characters who employ them in tasteful household arrangement, or exchange them with sweethearts and sell them off when love departs.</span><a href="#note68" id="marker68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
			<p>Considerably more subtle, however, but far-reaching in impact, were the stylistic changes in literature that were brought about by the broader visual culture in which photography participated. What we might call the pictorial emphasis of the Victorian novel &#8212; its predilection for description; its attention to theater and scene; its sensitivity to point of view and perspective &#8212; is arguably a symptom of the omnipresence of image making in Victorian society to which photography contributed. Dickens&#8217;s fondness for using the present tense in moments of heightened visual attention and pathos anticipates the shift to the present tense that we today undertake without thinking as we show others our own lives in photographs.</span><a href="#note69" id="marker69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
			<p>Photography&#8217;s implicitly democratic message also emerges in a variety of ways throughout the literature of the period. Toward the end of George Eliot&#8217;s </span><em>Middlemarch</em> (1871), for example, the heroine, Dorothea, gets up after a night spent on the floor. Previously consumed with her own romantic distress, in the early morning light she feels a need to put aside self-interest and reach out and connect with the wider world:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>She opened her curtains, and looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures moving &#8212; perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labour and endurance. She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining.<a href="#note70" id="marker70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This is a vitally important moment, not just for Dorothea and the rest of </span><em>Middlemarch</em> but for the history of the novel itself. It marks as deeply significant the simple and invisible act of </span><em>thinking</em>, but it also suggests that the view from the country house &#8212; from Lacock Abbey and places like it &#8212; might be widening to encompass a broader world. Dorothea does not reach for a camera to record the figures who are outside the entrance gates, but the eye of fiction notes them and forces an acknowledgment by its readers as well as its heroine that the human lot is inevitably bound up with those who walk and work and live beyond the boundary of one&#8217;s own life. Meanwhile, photography, too, began to demonstrate an increased imaginative sympathy for the lives of the working poor and to force a growing sense of the commonality of human existence. Henry Mayhew&#8217;s three-volume work of social record, </span><em>London Labour and the London Poor</em> (1851), was copiously illustrated with engravings made from photographs of street merchants, hustlers, and representatives of London&#8217;s underclass. As much as the work invited the gaze of the armchair tourist who might never set foot in the East End, Mayhew&#8217;s portraits insisted upon the reader&#8217;s shared humanity with those at the fringes of society. The sense of a wider world that Dorothea begins to feel in </span><em>Middlemarch</em> speaks, like Mayhew&#8217;s work, to the implicit </span><em>similarities</em> as much as to the differences among people.</span></p>
			<p>Those similarities suggest one reason &#8212; perhaps the main reason &#8212; why the Victorians seem more real to us than persons of earlier ages. It&#8217;s not merely the proximity of our era and theirs; it is also that the Victorians are the first human beings whom we can see through a medium we consider to be both modern and, curiously, our own: the photographic.</span><a href="#note71" id="marker71"><sup>71</sup></a> Unable to discriminate, photography emphasizes that all are a part of &#8220;involuntary, palpitating life&#8221;; in fact, a portrait photograph really signifies only that one </span><em>has</em> been part of that life. To many Victorians, it was a pity that photography had come too late to capture earlier figures from history. &#8220;Could we now see in photogenic light and shadow Demosthenes launching his thunder against Macedon,&#8221; imagined one dreamer in 1843, &#8220;or Brutus at Pompey&#8217;s statue bending over the bleeding Caesar &#8212; or Paul preaching at Athens &#8212; or Him whom we must not name, in godlike attitude and celestial beauty, proclaiming good-will to man, with what rapture would we gaze upon impersonations so exciting and divine!&#8221;</span><a href="#note72" id="marker72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
			<p>If it was too late to get a photo of Jesus of Nazareth, other celebrity photographs were very popular. In New York in 1851, Mr. Gavitt&#8217;s studio at the corner of Broadway and Murray Street offered a wonderful display:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>There is not a single great man in our country without his likeness there, and there are 170 pictures of distinguished Americans now no more, but who were living within the past six years. There was a likeness of the heroic Jackson, taken by an artist three days before the veteran died; Audibon [<em>sic</em>], Sir John Herschel, and many other men of note. All our great military and naval characters are to be seen there.<a href="#note73" id="marker73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In Britain there was a similar trade in photographs of the royal family and members of the aristocracy. Their portraits could be purchased at studios and became for a while collectible items for both the middle and upper classes. Constance Talbot wrote to her husband in April 1862:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Could you get us a good Portrait of the Prince varying from the one sent to Ela, for the purpose of adding to your collection of Celebrities &#8212; Also a Portrait of the Queen, and as many others of the Royal family as you can meet with that are really good &#8212; We would put them into your Carte de visite Album wh. has many blank pages at present.<a href="#note74" id="marker74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>These &#8220;card-portraits,&#8221; as Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809&#8211;1894) called them &#8212; small portrait photographs made not just for commercial purposes but also for private exchange &#8212; had by 1863 become &#8220;the social currency, the sentimental &#8216;Green-backs&#8217; of civilization&#8221; &#8212; and no wonder; as Holmes noted, the small portrait photo &#8220;is the cheapest, the most portable, requires no machine to look at it with, can be seen by several persons at the same time, &#8212; in short, has all the popular elements. Many care little for the wonders of the world brought before their eyes by the stereoscope; all love to see the faces of their friends.&#8221;</span><a href="#note75" id="marker75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
			<p>The practice of putting images into bound volumes and scrapbooks was well established before the advent of photography, and the carte de visite moved easily into the culture of albums, collage, and other mixed-media techniques already popular in Victorian homes. With astonishing rapidity, photography thus became part of the everyday world of all Victorians, a staple of home furnishing and domestic amusement, in evidence on every high street, in shop windows, and in the wider culture of commerce. To some extent, therefore, as it became ordinary, photography became less, rather than more, noticeable. &#8220;These miracles are being worked all around us so easily and so cheaply,&#8221; wrote Holmes, &#8220;that most people have ceased to think of them as marvels.&#8221;</span><a href="#note76" id="marker76"><sup>76</sup></a> Holmes was disappointed by this, since he regarded photography as the greatest invention of the age and one whose limits could not possibly be imagined. Like their British counterparts, however, Holmes&#8217;s fellow Americans were already taxed with grasping the numerous technological breakthroughs of the day (Holmes&#8217;s examples of challenges to the modern imagination are the railway, the telegraph, and chloroform). Photography was just one among many astonishing innovations. But Holmes felt that it was photography&#8217;s </span><em>potential</em> that made it the era&#8217;s most powerful one; its future was &#8220;not so easily, completely, universally recognized in all the immensity of its applications and suggestions.&#8221;</span><a href="#note77" id="marker77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
			<p>Although Holmes was right about photography&#8217;s unimaginable potential &#8212; its descendants, the information technologies and social media of the twenty-first century, are arguably restructuring the nature of human relations &#8212; in some ways what is most radical and profound about photography was immediately obvious to the Victorians. As Holmes puts it: &#8220;Those whom we love no longer leave us in dying, as they did of old.&#8221; While our eyes &#8220;lose the images pictured on them,&#8221; and even parents &#8220;forget the faces of their own children in a separation of a year or two,&#8221; the &#8220;artificial retina &#8230; retains their impress.&#8221; In the era of a newly conceived sense of historical and human oblivion, photography was miraculous: &#8220;How these shadows last, and how their originals fade away!&#8221;</span><a href="#note78" id="marker78"><sup>78</sup></a> It is hardly surprising that it was precisely this promise of reprieve from mortality that drove much of the marketing of portrait photographs. The prudent Victorian was advised to &#8220;secure the shadow &#8217;ere the substance fade&#8221; by letting &#8220;nature imitate what Nature made.&#8221;</span><a href="#note79" id="marker79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

    		<h3>Photography and the End of an Age</h3>
			<p>The last two decades of the Victorian age saw further refinements in the photographic process. In 1871 the dry plate process was invented, making photography faster and much less cumbersome. Dry plates, sturdier than wet collodion, could be prepared in advance and were easier to transport. In 1888 George Eastman introduced flexible dry film and the small, hand-held Kodak camera. Not only might photography now be practiced by more people; pictures could also be taken more discreetly. When two brothers in Germany patented a camera designed to be hidden in a hat, <em>Punch</em> magazine responded with some verse:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If they knew what I wear when I walk in the street,<br />
				It should be quite a terror to people I meet;<br />
				They would fly when they saw me, and ne&#8217;er stop to chat,<br />
				For I carry a camera up in my hat.</p>
				<p>A Herr Luders, of G&#246;rlitz, has patented this,<br />
				And I think the idea is by no means amiss;<br />
				With a hole in my hat for the lens to peep through,<br />
				And a dry plate behind, I take portrait or view.<a href="#note80" id="marker80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Although outside spy novels the photographic hat has yet to catch on, the newly simplified processes of photography ensured that by the 1880s it was in everyday use in police work and detective surveillance. Meanwhile, down in the Dorset countryside, Hardy was learning the meaning of fame in a photographic age and was disgruntled to find himself the subject of tourist cameras aimed by cyclists over the hedges of his garden at Max Gate. In London, Henry James reflected in his notebooks on the eroding boundary between public and private spheres, a consequence, he felt, of the &#8220;devouring publicity&#8221; of modern life.</span><a href="#note81" id="marker81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
			<p>As if to validate those concerns, in 1897 an anonymous &#8220;Member of the Royal Household&#8221; published a tell-all narrative about Queen Victoria&#8217;s private life, a work presumably designed to profit from the queen&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee that year.</span><a href="#note82" id="marker82"><sup>82</sup></a> With a full-length photographic portrait of the queen as its frontispiece, and a preface explaining its method of visualizing Victoria as borrowed from &#8220;that of the old masters of the Dutch school,&#8221; the book promised to help the reader picture the details of Victoria&#8217;s daily life in all its splendor. Insisting that its realism is assured by the copiousness of its details, the book recalls the appeal of early daguerreotypes: the more that is seen and known, the text implies, the closer the viewer may come to the </span><em>real</em> queen.</span></p>
			<p>But by 1897 the notion of a shared and verifiable reality was noticeably in question, as was the idea that empiricism and the accumulation of visual detail could yield satisfactory answers to questions about the nature of human existence. As fiction by James, Hardy, Wilde, and others was showing, personal identity was no longer necessarily understood in static terms, the sum total of a fixed number of facts. It was susceptible to change, circumstance, perceptual nuance. It altered across time. As the art critic Roger Fry put it in his discussion of Impressionism (1894), &#8220;what &#8230; we call the same human figure, is not the same inside the studio that it was outside, is not the same at 5 p.m. that it was at 2 p.m. It is in each case only a momentary group of sensations in the perpetual flux, existing in necessary relations to its surroundings and an inseparable part of them.&#8221;</span><a href="#note83" id="marker83"><sup>83</sup></a> While the single photograph might suggest permanence, over the course of time photography tells a different story. A family album kept throughout many years speaks of mutability; it maps the story of genetic inheritance, making visible time&#8217;s passage. Holmes&#8217;s words in 1861 are eerily prescient:</span></p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Children grow into beauty and out of it. The first line in the forehead, the first streak in the hair are chronicled without malice, but without extenuation. The footprints of thought, of passion, of purpose are all treasured in these fossilized shadows. Family-traits show themselves in early infancy, die out, and reappear. Flitting moods which have escaped one pencil of sunbeams are caught by another. Each new picture gives us a new aspect of our friend; we find he had not one face, but many.<a href="#note84" id="marker84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Each new picture made by a camera arguably helped usher in the time-obsessed age of Modernism, an age that was to be haunted by the multiplicity of the self, a self represented by Cubist painters as having &#8220;not one face, but many.&#8221; Modernist literature of the early twentieth century is preoccupied with the ambiguity of the word and the unreliability of narration; it addresses itself to a generation that will witness the shattering of the idea of objective truth into innumerable past, potential, and simultaneous points of view. In all this, photography will play a part.</p>
			<p>The notion that human identity is neither stable, nor unified, nor ultimately knowable is absent, however, from the tell-all book about the queen. The aim of the work, after all, was to &#8220;fix&#8221; Victoria&#8217;s image. One of its revelations is how self-conscious the queen was about that image &#8212; how much she was aware of &#8220;performing&#8221; her royal, married, domestic self. &#8220;It is quite a weakness of hers,&#8221; we hear, &#8220;to be photographed in every possible condition of her daily life. Sitting in her donkey chair, dangling [</span><em>sic</em>] the latest new baby, chatting in her private sitting-room among her daughters, working at her writing-table, or breakfasting in the open air &#8230; the Queen&#8217;s photographer is always to be sent for and ordered to &#8216;fix the picture.&#8217; &#8221;</span><a href="#note85" id="marker85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
			<p>Although Victoria was aware of the value of photography to the public image of a modern monarch, she remained to the end of her life an avid private consumer of photographs, every bit as interested in perusing albums as she had been as a young woman first introduced to photogenic drawings. According to our anonymous source, one of her more notable &#8220;fads and fancies&#8221; was that she required everything in her possession to be photographed. &#8220;Every piece of plate and china, every picture, chair, table, ornament, and articles of even the most trivial description, all pass through the photographer&#8217;s hands, and are &#8216;taken&#8217; from every point of view.&#8221; The resulting photographs were then arranged in &#8220;wonderful bound catalogues,&#8221; vast volumes that were &#8220;many in number, large in bulk, and &#8230; most expensive.&#8221; We hear that &#8220;Her Majesty is very fond of her catalogues, and few days pass without her sending for one volume or another.&#8221;</span><a href="#note86" id="marker86"><sup>86</sup></a> It&#8217;s not entirely clear from this account whether the queen liked her albums because of the objects or the people represented in them. What we </span><em>are</em> told is that she has &#8220;a sweet reverence for past happy times&#8221; and reveals &#8220;a clinging that is touching in its intensity to everything that reflects ever so slightly on the &#8216;days that are no more.&#8217; &#8221;</span><a href="#note87" id="marker87"><sup>87</sup></a> As the cultural historian Stephen Kern puts it, &#8220;Every age &#8230; has a distinctive sense of the past. This generation looked to it for stability in the face of rapid technological, cultural, and social change.&#8221;</span><a href="#note88" id="marker88"><sup>88</sup></a> What could be more consoling to the widowed monarch in her last years than these bound volumes of photographs in which nothing more could ever change? What surer place to find stability than in images of the past?</span></p>
			<p>Photography&#8217;s nostalgic appeal must have been particularly powerful at the close of the nineteenth century &#8212; the first century, as Talbot might have put it, to have &#8220;drawn its own picture.&#8221; Through the auspices of photography, Victoria was the first British monarch able to revisit almost all the years of her long reign. In her albums she could view images of her children and their weddings, and of her husband &#8212; in life and, later, as a marble effigy. Victoria herself now exists for us in photographs as a young woman, as an elderly matriarch &#8212; even on her deathbed. Tucked inside her coffin, unseen by anyone and unbeknown to most, were several photographs that she had previously selected to take with her </span>(</span>fig. 14</span>).</span><a href="#note89" id="marker89"><sup>89</sup></a> Her funeral procession on February 2, 1901, was not just photographed but filmed; one can find it today on YouTube.</span></p>
			<p>Daguerre was long dead by then, as were Talbot and Herschel, but many other photographers were stationed along the route of the funeral procession as it wound slowly through London </span>(</span>fig. 15</span>). With the help of a ladder, one of them even managed to scramble up on top of the Marble Arch, where he perched perilously, braving the bitter cold, the long hours of waiting, and the seemingly endless repetition of Chopin&#8217;s Funeral March, to get the best picture that he could.</span><a href="#note90" id="marker90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

			<p><a href="#marker90" id="note90">90</a>&#9;In the moment at which the queen&#8217;s coffin passed beneath the arch, the photographer Paul Martin, who was standing at the monument&#8217;s base, had what is to modern readers a familiar experience: &#8220;Off came our hats and click went the shutters of the cameras. I have a faint recollection of seeing a Union Jack which covered the coffin, also the Kaiser on a white horse. My camera saw it all, but I had to wait until it could transfer to me the beauty and the solemnity of the occasion.&#8221; In other words, Martin missed the procession because he was too busy taking a picture of it. &#8220;You naturally like to take as many [pictures] as you can, so that your entire attention is centred on your job and you miss the pageant. Seeing the impressive scene on your dull view-finder of the size of a stamp does not fling you into a state of uncontrolled ecstasy or reverence.&#8221; It was Martin&#8217;s colleague who braved the too-short ladder and managed to haul himself up onto the arch. According to Martin, &#8220;he obtained quite good results, as being higher up he had a good view.&#8221; Paul Martin, <em>Victorian Snapshots</em> (London, 1939; repr., New York, 1973), 35.</p>
